    "\n",
    "A: Assertion statements make sure you are on the right track with your code.  If you are counting words for example and you run a chunk of code, an assertion statement can help to make sure the code that you ran is true.  If you are trying to count the number of sentences in a text file, how do you know the returned number is true?  The code you ran could have been incorrect or had an error and if you just take it blindly, you don't know if the mistake is made and you could continue with your code with false information.  An assertion statement in this example would be checking to see maybe what the first sentence is based on your return and the last, this way you can be sure all sentences are accounted for.  Essentially like a version of unit testing kind of, it makes sure that your code is not buggy. "
